# Hugo Arriojas' Portfolio

Here is the Github repo for my portfolio as seen on https://www.hugoa.dev/

I made this to showcase some of the work that I've done and will continue to update it as my career in Web dev progresses.

Some next implementations that I want to add include:
- JS functionality on scroll so that "current section" is tracked
- Showing Hover text for the skills section in order to increase readability
- Adding a "testimonials from LinkedIn" section

Thank you for checking out my repo!
Please feel free to contact me through my site if you have any questions
